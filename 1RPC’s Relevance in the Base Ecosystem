Base’s design as a scalable, cost-effective L2 makes it an ideal environment for dApps, NFTs, and DeFi protocols. However, interacting with blockchains requires reliable RPC endpoints to connect wallets and applications to the network. 1RPC.io enhances Base’s ecosystem by addressing privacy, security, and accessibility challenges, making it a vital infrastructure component.Why 1RPC Matters for BasePrivacy Protection for Base Users
Base’s growing user base, including creators, developers, and DeFi participants, relies on secure blockchain interactions. Traditional RPC providers often expose metadata like IP addresses or batch request data, which can link user accounts and reveal identities. 1RPC’s TEE-based relays mask this metadata and disassociate multicall requests, ensuring Base users’ privacy. For example, 1RPC’s “burn after relaying” approach wipes all metadata post-request, providing true zero-tracking privacy.

Seamless Wallet Integration
1RPC simplifies the process of connecting wallets like MetaMask to Base. By providing a dedicated Base RPC endpoint (https://1rpc.io/base), users can add Base to their wallets with a single click, streamlining access to Base’s ecosystem. This is particularly valuable for Base’s NFT platforms like Zora or DeFi protocols, where users need quick and secure access to onchain services.

Anti-Phishing Safeguards
Phishing attacks are a significant threat in Web3, with users often tricked into signing malicious transactions. 1RPC’s transaction sanitizers, configurable via its dashboard, validate addresses for each eth_sendRawTransaction request, protecting Base users from fund-draining scams. This feature is critical for Base’s retail-focused user base, including those engaging with everyday apps on platforms like World Chain, which 1RPC also supports.
