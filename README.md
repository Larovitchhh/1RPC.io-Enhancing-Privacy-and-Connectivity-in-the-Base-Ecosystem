1RPC.io: Enhancing Privacy and Connectivity in the Base Ecosystem
The Base ecosystem, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution developed by Coinbase, has rapidly gained traction for its low-cost, high-throughput environment tailored for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized applications (dApps). As Base continues to attract developers and users, the need for secure, private, and reliable blockchain interactions has become paramount. Enter 1RPC.io, a pioneering Web3 Remote Procedure Call (RPC) relay service that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide privacy-protected, fully attested blockchain connectivity. This article explores 1RPC.ioâ€™s features and its critical role in the Base ecosystem.
